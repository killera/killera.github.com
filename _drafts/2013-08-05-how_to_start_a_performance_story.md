In the previous [post][performance_forgottern_realm], I have suggested that it is an appropriate time to do performance test after a story or a feature is done. So, how to write a performance test story?

## What need to be considered in performance test?

We already know that performance testing contains two parts: implement performance testing scripts and do performance tuning. So it is better to split the task into two parts accordingly.

1. story for implementing performance testing scripts
2. story for runing performance test, find whether there is a performance issue, and then do performance tuning.
