### Preparation

In some projects, people use string as primary key of the table(we won't discuss if it's a good or bad design here). Sometimes, people might add the value with different cases in foreign key column. For SqlServer, if you install it with default options, the sql is case insensitive. For example, we have table Product and Category definition as below:

```sql
-- Category
CREATE TABLE [Category](
	[Code] [nvarchar](10) NOT NULL,
	[Name] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PK_Category] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
	[Code] ASC
)
)
--Product
CREATE TABLE [Product](
    [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [Name] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [CategoryCode] [nvarchar](10) NOT NULL
 CONSTRAINT [PK_Product] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
	[Id] ASC
)
)

ALTER TABLE [Product]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [fk_Product_Category] FOREIGN KEY([CategoryCode])
REFERENCES [Category] ([Code])
GO
```

And we add two records into DB.

```sql
--Category
insert into Category values ('ELEC', 'Electronics')
--Product
insert into Product values ('Mobile Phone', 'elec')
```

The following sql return the same data:
```sql
-- Category
select * from Category where Code = 'ELEC'
select * from Category where Code = 'elec'

--Product 
select * from Product where CategoryCode = 'ELEC'
select * from Product where CategoryCode = 'elec'
```

### Entity Framework Core Implementation

Now we will try to use EntityFrameworkCore to load the data:

The class definition will look like:

```csharp 
public class Product
{
    [Key]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name {get; set;}

    [ForeignKey("Category")]
    public string CategoryCode {get; set;}
    public virtual Category Category {get;set;}
}

public class Category
{
    [Key]
    public string Code {get; set;}
    public string Name {get; set;}
}
```


In DbContext class we defined the DbSet for both entities:

```csharp
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products {get;set;}
    public DbSet<Category> Categories {get;set;}
}
```

Then we add records to Product table and Category table.

```sql
--Product
1, 'Mobile Phone', 'elec'
--Category
'ELEC', 'Electronics'
```

Then we try to select the produt data including the category with the following code: 

```csharp
var product  = dbContext.Products.Include(x => x.Category).SingleOrDefault(x => x.Id == 1);
```

The result we expected is that the product **[Mobile Phone]** is loaded with Category property set correctly. But when we examine the object, the Category navigation property is null.

If we inspect the sql generated by entity framework core, we found actually the category is found and returned, but the entity framework didn't build the relationship between them.

The reason is because the `CategoryCode` for Product **[Mobile Phone]** is in lower case(`elec`), but the `Code` of Category **[Electronics]** is in upper case (`ELEC`). when entity framework core compare the two values, it didn't treat them as equal.


### Solution / Work around

The [issue](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/673) has already been raised in github, but the target fix release version is `3.0.0`, which means we have to find a workaround.

For now, there are several ways to fix it:

* Update the databse to make the case match.


* Or tell Entity Framework to do a convert when loading the data. For example, convert the `Code` of Category to lower case, or convert the `CategoryCode` of Product to upper case.

If possible, I highly recommend to make a migration to make sure the data store in db having the same case. But if it's not applicable, we can use the 2 option to do a quick fix in the code level.

The code of conversion in entity framework `MyDbContext` class is as follow:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Product>.Property(e => e.CategoryCode)
            .HasConversion(p => p, s => s.ToUpper());
}
```

After added the above code, entity framework can associate the navigation property correctly.
