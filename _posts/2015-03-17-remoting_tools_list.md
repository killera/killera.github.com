When I worked on a project, I need to do remote pairing with my colleagues at the beginning. We spiked several remoting tools，here is the comparison between them:

Tool  | video quality | remote control | stability 
:-:   |      :--:     |      :--:      |   :--:
Skype |      ★★       |       No       | ★
TeamViewer|  ★        |      Yes       | ★★★
join.me|    ★★        |      Yes       | ★(has sound issue in some mac laptops)
zoom.us|    ★★★       | Yes            | ★★★ 
Fuze |    --       | --            | can not connect during testing
ScreenHero|  ★★★  |  Yes  |  not between China & AU
Google Hangouts| ★★★|No | Yes
Gotomeeting| 30 days free drive, |we didn't try it, |as at the beginning we only want to remote paring


*`The data only reflect the results during our testing among AU and China, maybe varies in different regions.`*

Finally we chose zoom.us, and it worked pretty good.

Later in another project(people in 5 countries), we use Fuze to do standup everyday, but Fuze has a connection issue in China too, I suggested the team switch to zoom.us, and it proves that our decision is correct. We also used it for pairing programming in that project.
